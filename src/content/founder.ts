    "Hey 👋 I'm Hakim. I built Easly because grocery trips kept stealing time from the rest of my life.",
  paragraphs: [
    "I used to walk the same store twice, backtracking for things I missed. My list was a chat thread, items weren't grouped, and I'd forget something almost every time.",
    'Easly started as a simple idea: what if your list followed the store layout, and the app quietly learned the route you actually take? If we can cut the wandering, we can cut the stress.',
    "Whether you're shopping for yourself or coordinating with family or a roommate, I want Easly to feel like a calm, smart list that gets you in and out, without the 'did we forget anything?' moment in the parking lot.",
  ],
  ps: 'If you have ideas or feedback, I read every message at support@h2adigital.com.',
