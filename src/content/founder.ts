    "Hey 👋 I'm Hakim. I built ChatWing because too many good conversations stall for the wrong reasons.",
  paragraphs: [
    'I watched friends overthink the perfect reply or second-guess their tone. The right message was in their head, but it never came out the way they meant.',
    'ChatWing started as a simple idea: what if your chats had a calm, smart co-pilot that could read the room and suggest better words?',
    'Whether you need a playful opener, a confident follow-up, or a respectful response, I want ChatWing to help you show up as your best self.',
  ],
  ps: 'If you have ideas or feedback, I read every message at support@h2adigital.com.',
